Intro section HTML, CSS , &amp; JavaScript challenge.
This is a project I did from a free challenge from Frontend Mentor. This is the biggest thing I've done so far- especially without help - and I've learned a lot
from it. Although in the grand scheme of things, this is a small project, for me it was still large enough to highlight the fact that I could use some improvment 
on naming conventions. I feel I may have overused clases, and I'm sure I get optimize the JavaScript and accomplish the same thing here with a lot less lines of 
code. But I feel good about what I was able to do here. Looking foward to improving my skills from here on out.
